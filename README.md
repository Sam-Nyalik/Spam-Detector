# Spam-Detector
This is a spam detector built with Python

# Description
In most messaging or emailing services, messages are detected as spam automatically so that these messages do not unnecessarily flood the user's inbox. It is possible or us to build Machine Learning/Deep Learning models to detect spam messages easily, because the messages are peculiar in nature. The texts in our project will be classified as "SPAM" or "HAM". Emprical Data Analysis will be performed on our dataset and a text classification model will be built
